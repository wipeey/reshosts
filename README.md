# Resolve Hosts! (reshosts)

---

A simple tool I built to improve my scripting skills and learn new stuff. (without using chatgpt...)

You must provide an IP address as an argument. Then, reshosts will ping through every IP address on the network provided and tell you which one are up or dead.
Have fun, but keep in mind that this project is just a way for me to experiment, thus probably making it slow compared to other professional scripts out there ;)
